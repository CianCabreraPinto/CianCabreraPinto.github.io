                                Hi, I'm Cian Cabrera-Pinto, and I'm a prospective UX/UI Designer from Waterford.
                                I am currently undertaking an undergraduate degree in Interaction Design at the University
                                of Limerick.
                                I chose this course because it integrates graphic design, visual design, research, and user
                                testing.
                                I have enjoyed designing interactive systems that work well for end users through my studies.
                                I plan to create more websites for local companies that are having a hard time with their
                                online presence.
                                I aspire to expand my business to reach the wider community by assisting individuals and
                                organizations
                                in creating their personal brands.

                    <p>
                        Chris Do inspires me through creativity by opening my eyes to the possibilities of freelance and
                        creative media.
                        Through his business website and YouTube channel, The Futur, he has offered hundreds of free
                        tutorials and
                        information that have been a goldmine to my growth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Virgil Abloh, the former creative director at Louis Vuitton and creator of Off-White, shows me that I
                        should
                        think differently and view things from different perspectives. His mantra, "If the student is a candle,
                        I could put this candle in an all-white gallery space it looks like a piece of art. If I put this candle
                        in a garage
                        it looks like a piece of trash," encourages me to always question and reinterpret the world around
                        me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Don Norman, the famous father of UX/UI Design, has made me curious to know more about how visual and
                        virtual
                        objects like websites are created and interpreted by the end users.

                        This website is my initial experience with web development and portfolio building. It is a broad
                        overview of my skills, interests, and inspirations as a potential UX/UI designer.

                    <p>
                        Since I build upon my expertise and aims, I aim to get involved with functional and research-based
                        projects all along through the span of study years. Gaining industrial perspectives and augmenting
                        the circle would be great. On a secondary level, I look to create web portals for my relatives and
                        acquaintances in need of internet access. Thus far, I have two ventures ready for my work completion.
